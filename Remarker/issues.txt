Issues

Performance Issue

Some users may experience longer than expected wait times opening the
Comments Setting options page. The reason for this is that on some
systems some fonts generate an Argument Exception when a program
queries whether the font supports the Regular style. Instead of a
negative response, an exception is raised.

The program now handles the exception, but the delay that is caused
by the exception is several seconds. If there are many such fonts,
there would be an exception for each problem font.

Sometimes deleting and re-installing the font will resolve this. But
sometimes the problem cannot be resolved unless the font is removed
or replaced. If the fonts are not used, it may be better just to
remove the font altogether.

I have a small program in the troubleshooting section of my document-
ation at http://remarker.codeplex.com/ that can help identify the
fonts that raise this exception.
